# ZOMATO-Dashboard(Power BI)

This case study analyzes the performance of Zomato, a leading online food delivery and restaurant discovery platform. Using data from their internal dashboard, we examine key metrics including sales, user demographics, geographic distribution, and customer retention. The study reveals Zomato's strengths in certain markets and food categories, while also highlighting areas for improvement, particularly in customer retention and market expansion.
Key findings include a total sales figure of 987M across 2M transactions, strong performance in cities like Tirupati and GTB Nagar Delhi, and a dominant market share for non-vegetarian food items. However, the company faces challenges with a high customer churn rate and a significant sales decline in 2020, likely due to external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
This case study provides insights and recommendations to help Zomato optimize its operations, improve customer retention, and drive sustainable growth in a competitive market landscape.
