# ZOMATO-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS----CASE-STUDY
## Project Overview

This case study analyzes the performance of Zomato, a leading online food delivery and restaurant discovery platform. Using data from their internal dashboard, we examine key metrics including sales, user demographics, geographic distribution, and customer retention. The study reveals Zomato's strengths in certain markets and food categories, while also highlighting areas for improvement, particularly in customer retention and market expansion.
Key findings include a total sales figure of 987M across 2M transactions, strong performance in cities like Tirupati and GTB Nagar Delhi, and a dominant market share for non-vegetarian food items. However, the company faces challenges with a high customer churn rate and a significant sales decline in 2020, likely due to external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
This case study provides insights and recommendations to help Zomato optimize its operations, improve customer retention, and drive sustainable growth in a competitive market landscape.

## Introduction

### Company Background

Zomato, founded in 2008, has grown from a restaurant discovery platform to a comprehensive food tech company offering delivery services, restaurant reservations, and more. Operating in numerous countries, Zomato has become a key player in the global food delivery market.

### Industry Context

The online food delivery industry has experienced rapid growth in recent years, driven by changing consumer preferences, urbanization, and technological advancements. However, the industry also faces challenges such as intense competition, regulatory pressures, and the need for continuous innovation.

## Problem Statement:
   
The dataset comprises essential parameters related to Zomato's operations, including sales figures, order counts, user demographics, food categories, ratings, and geographic performance. We aim to analyse this data to identify patterns, trends, and key performance indicators (KPIs) that can inform Zomato about market preferences, customer demographics, sales strategies, and operational effectiveness. The goal is to provide evidence-based strategies to optimize Zomato's offerings, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve overall business performance.

## About Dataset:

This dataset contains information on Zomato's performance across various metrics from the year 2017 to 2020. It includes data on overall sales, number of orders, user demographics, food category performance, year-over-year trends, and geographic distribution of sales and ratings. The dataset encompasses a mix of categorical and numeric values, with insights into customer behaviour, sales performance, and regional variations.

## Tools
Power BI

## Description of columns in the dataset:

There are multiple data sets they are users(users name, ID, gander, age, marital status), orders( number of orders from different restaurants), restaurant(restaurants with their location and the ratings for the same), menu( the menu of the restaurant), food( name of the dish and its type e.g. veg or non-veg), order type( the order ID and its type). 

## Benefits of the analysis:

By conducting these analyses, Zomato can gain insights into market preferences and customer demographics, optimize sales strategies and tailor food offerings, enhance customer satisfaction and retention, improve operational efficiency, and make data-driven decisions for expansion and growth. Through these benefits, this analysis contributes to making Zomato more responsive to customers' needs and preferences while improving its business performance.

## Data Analysis Approach:

We employed a mixed-method approach, combining quantitative analysis of sales and user data with qualitative assessment of market trends and user behaviour. Key performance indicators (KPIs) were calculated to benchmark Zomato's performance.

##   Recommended Analysis:
    - Calculate the total sales amount and total number of orders.
    - Analyse the performance of different food categories (Non-Veg, Veg, Other) in terms of sales and ratings.
    - Examine the year-over-year sales trends to identify growth patterns and potential issues.
    - Investigate user demographics, particularly age distribution and gender split of gained and lost customers.
    - Evaluate geographic performance by analysing sales, ratings, and active users across different cities.
    - Identify the top-performing cities in terms of sales and user engagement.
    - Examine the average order value and its variation across different parameters (e.g., cities, food categories).
    - Investigate the relationship between active users and sales performance in different cities.
